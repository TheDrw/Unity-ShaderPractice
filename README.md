Learning Shader Things

Here are some things I made messing around when learning shaders. They are in the PostEffectShader.shader file. I don't know if it will work
on anything or is optimized in anyway, but it runs on my editor with 1000+fps - maybe that is good, I think. You can grab it if you want.
CoolUIShader is from Quill18's tutorial and UniteKat.shader is from a Unity tutorial.
