Learning Shader Things

Here are some things I made messing around when learning shaders. They are in the PostEffectShader.shader file. I don't know if it will work on anything or is optimized in anyway, but it runs on my editor with 1000+fps - maybe that is good, I think. You can grab it if you want. Details on what it is and stuff with be updated soon or something.

CoolUIShader is from Quill18's tutorial and KatUniteShader.shader is from Unity's Unite LA 2016 tutorial thing.
