# Unity-ShaderPractice

Here are some things I made messing around when learning shaders. They are in the PostEffectShader.shader file. I don't know if it will work on anything or is optimized in anyway, but it runs on my editor with 1000+fps - maybe that is good, I think. You can grab it if you want. Details on what it is and stuff with be updated soon or something.

# Shaders not from me
CoolUIShader.shader is from Quill18's tutorial and KatUniteShader.shader is from Unity's Unite LA 2016 tutorial thing. The PostEffectShader was a base of Quill18's tutorial, but I branched off and did my own thing and explored with math stuff.
